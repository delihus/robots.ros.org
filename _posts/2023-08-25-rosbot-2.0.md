> End-of-Life notice
>
> Starting from August 31 ROSbot 2 will go end-of-life. As of this date, new features wonâ€™t be developed for ROSbot 2 and we will no longer be providing support for this model.
>
> If you require continued support and advanced capabilities, please consider switching to [ROSbot 2R](./2023-08-25-rosbot-2r.md) or [ROSbot 2 PRO](./2019-04-16-rosbot-2.0-pro.md).
> ROSbot is an autonomous, open source robot platform based on ROS. Reinforced with set of tutorials, manuals, simulation model and examples, it is a great choice for prototyping and learning how to program autonomous vehicles.

It integrates:

- CPU: Rockchip RK3288, Quad-core ARM Cortex-A17 32-bit processor, 1.8 GHz
- GPU: ARM Mali-T764 MP2
- RAM: 2GB LPDDR3
- IMU: MPU 9250 or BNO055 (accelerometer + gyro)
- Distance sensor: VL53L0X (time-of-flight)
- 4-wheel mobile platform with DC motors
- Li-ion batteries: 3 x 3500 mAh (with protection circuits)
- Rear panel providing interfaces for additional modules
- Robust aluminum chassis
