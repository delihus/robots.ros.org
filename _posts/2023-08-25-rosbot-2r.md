introduction: ROSbot 2R is an autonomous, open source robot platform based on Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64). Reinforced with a development platform and free online resources such as set of tutorials, manuals, simulation model and more, it is a great choice for prototyping and learning how to program autonomous vehicles. ROS and ROS 2 system image options are available.
